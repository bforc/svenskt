<h3 data-start="580" data-end="616">What Makes Swedish Candy Unique?</h3>
<p data-start="618" data-end="1099">Swedish candy is known for its clean ingredients, strong flavors, and broad variety. Unlike many American candies that rely heavily on corn syrup and artificial flavoring, Swedish sweets often use real sugar, natural colorants, and less cloying sweetness. One of the most iconic categories is <strong data-start="911" data-end="929">salty licorice</strong> (<em data-start="931" data-end="940">salmiak</em>), a divisive but beloved treat in Sweden. This intense flavor—salty, slightly bitter, and complex—is an acquired taste that many Americans are curious to try.</p>
<p data-start="1101" data-end="1473">Beyond licorice, Swedish candy also includes fruity gummies in fun shapes like fish (think Swedish Fish, although the original versions in Sweden have different textures and flavors), sour belts, marshmallow confections, and filled chocolates. Popular brands such as <strong data-start="1368" data-end="1378">Malaco</strong>, <strong data-start="1380" data-end="1391">Cloetta</strong>, <strong data-start="1393" data-end="1400">Kex</strong>, and <strong data-start="1406" data-end="1417">Marabou</strong> produce a wide range of sweets that appeal to all ages.</p>
